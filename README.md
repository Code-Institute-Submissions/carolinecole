### Design Choices
* I designed this website to be 

### Fonts
I chose to use Montserrat font from [Google Fonts](https://https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat?preview.text_type=custom&sidebar.open=true&selection.family=Montserrat:wght@100) in my project because it is simple, easy to read and stylist. 

### Icons
I chose to use the Twitter, Youtube and Instagram icons in my project with links to those pages from [Font awesome](https://fontawesome.com/).

### Colours
I chose to keep the colours simple using dark grey for fonts and a white background. My page is a blog which will consist of lots of images and information, therefore I did not want make anything too busy. During my projeect I decided to use black for my heading to make it stand out as much as possible and a darker grey for the writing.

### Styling

### Backgrounds
I chose to keepo the backgrounds plain white because I will be adding images and I do not want it to look messy, or distract user from the page content.

### Bugs Discovered 
#### Solved bugs
1. The font was coming up with an error when opened the DevTools. I went onto Tutor support to get some assistance as to which I needed to hard reload my browser.
2. The menu bar was showing on two lines instead of one, to fix this I used [Code Institue](this code was taken from https://learn.codeinstitute.net/courses/course-v1:codeinstitute+FE+2017_T3/courseware/616289d66b5641a3808cc43e53842695/f99dac3afcfe4b2caf8d576273aea3e6/?child=first to eliminate the contact menu item being below) lesson to help fix this issue. 
3. The menu bar was not centered to the page, it was positioned to the right of the page. To solve this I asked tutor support and I had a div taking up a huge section of the page so I removed the below code which I got from [Code Institue](https://learn.codeinstitute.net/courses/course-v1:codeinstitute+FE+2017_T3/courseware/616289d66b5641a3808cc43e53842695/f99dac3afcfe4b2caf8d576273aea3e6/?child=first):
    ```<div class="row no-gutters">
        <a href="index.html" class="col-md-4 logo"></a>
        <div class="col-md-8"> 
           <div class="row bg-color-name-title">
           ```
After amending this code, it menu bar still was not in the center of the page. I spend a while looking at my website on DevTools and selecting bit and eventually I added in the below code to CSS targeting the menu bar which has fixed the problem. 
```.menucontainer {
    font-size: 0px;
    text-align: center;
    } 
    ```

    
4. The font awesome social media icons I used did not load, after checking my links from font awesome I changed it slightly and it started working.
5. Image on my about page did not load, I used [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_images.asp) for coding tips and then asked tutor support. I had not added the full image link so amended this and it worked.
